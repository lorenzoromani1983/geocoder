This Python class returns coordinates for a specified physical address and the Facebook/Instagram locations nearby, leveraging the Google Maps Api key and the Instagram locations api endpoint.

Just set up your Google Maps Api key as an environment variable or explicitly specify it within the script:

self.google_maps_api_key = "your api key here"

Instagram authentication is skipped as the script grabs your Chrome Instagram cookies. This implies that you need to be logged into Instagram on Chrome in order to get everything right.
